Creating a shortcode to display DHL Tracking information to end-user.
Connects to the public API of DHL in order to track shipments made on DHL Freight

== Description ==
This plugin connects to  the Active Tracing API of DHL Freight and creates a shortcode that can be inserted anywhere in your woocommerce site.
It creates a form where you can search based on shipment ID or your own order-reference.
Place shortcode `[woo-dhl-tracking-form][/woo-dhl-tracking-form]` in any page or post to render the form.
In the case that you are using non-unique order-references you can define your API keys in order to limit the consignments to your accounts.

## Tracking Link
If you wish you can enable tracking links to be added to the order-confirmation pages sent to your customers.
The link can be populated with the trackingID or orderID depending on your settings.

That is because your ID is not unique in DHLs systems. Either search by trackingID, or sign up with myACT in order to limit your requests to only your shipments.
